The subsequent rapid development of office space around the   mall provided the jobs to support massive construction of apartment   complexes, which now dominate much of the landscape. The real estate   bust of the last decade produced significant deterioration in those   complexes, and led to the creation of a management district. Crime has   been significantly reduced and renovation of the apartments led to a   revitalized area.",

    "communityDescriptionAndHistory": "In 1938, James Marion West, a wealthy business man   with interest in ranching and oil, sold 30,000 acres which included his   family ranch in southern Harris County to Humble Oil and Refining   Company (now Exxon Mobile). Most of the property remained undeveloped   until 1961 when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration   selected Houston as the site for its Manned Spacecraft Center (renamed   the Johnson Space Center in 1973) and built the space center development   on a 1,000-acre tract of the former West ranch. Humble Oil's venture,   the Friendswood Development Company, made plans in 1963 to establish a   master-planned residential development to support the new space industry   and established the Clear Lake City Community Association, Inc.   (CLCCA). Governor John Connally formally opened Clear Lake City on   September 15, 1963. In 1968, the first year for which population   statistics are available, 3,785 people lived in Clear Lake City. By 1970   the population had grown to 8,000, and in 1974 it was 16,000. New home   construction continues in the northern part of the development.",
